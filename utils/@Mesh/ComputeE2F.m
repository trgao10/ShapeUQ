function E2F = ComputeE2F(obj)
% COMPUTEE2F computes E2F matrix: Ne by Nf matrix such that every entry
%             (e,f) = 1 iff  edge e is on face f, 0 otherwise.
%   input: TriangleMesh object
%   output: E2F as described above

% now we get the edge indices for each face: the way we do it is not

% thus for each edge (row) in unique(E(:,1:2)) this vector contains index
% this row
