function E = ComputeE(obj)
% COMPUTEE computes E matrix. The edges are given as (i,j) where i<j, 
%           and are sorted lexicographically.
%   input: TriangleMesh object
%   output: E as described above

% we sort every row such that (i,j) where i<j thus, E(i,1) < E(i,2)

% sorting the rows lexicographically
